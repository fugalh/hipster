Usage
-----
Choose the 8 pages out of core.pdf which you would like to use, and create the
hipster PDA with a command like the following:

    ./hipsterize -page 86,26,46,26,46,82,84,89 core.pdf

The result will be in core-up.pdf. If you have an 8-page PDF, you can simply
run this command to impose it:

    ./hipsterize master.pdf

Again, the result is in master-up.pdf. You can bring any PDF to the party, by
first merging with core, e.g.:

    ./multivalent merge -append core.pdf circle_of_fifths.pdf

If you are lucky enough to live where A4 paper is used, modify the
script appropriately.

Now just print (don't let your PDF reader resize it) and chop up with a paper
cutter, then punch holes.

I've done the weekly pages refill for you already, in weekly.pdf.

Requirements
------------
You need Java and a bourne shell. The Multivalent jar is included.
